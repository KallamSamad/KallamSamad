## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Kallam and I am a Computer Science student at Sheffield Hallam University. 

I plan on posting every project I do whilst in Uni and potentially refining my code by collaborating with others to do so. 

I also intend to do some independent projects (outside the classroom) with or without a team. Feel free to add suggestions to refine my code
or ask for help.

All this is to improve and evolve as a computer scientist to ultimately be prepared for the years ahead!
