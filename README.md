## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Kallam and I am a Computer Science student at Sheffield Hallam University. 

I plan on posting every project I do whilst in Uni and potentially refining my code by collaborating with others to do so. 

I also intend to do some independent projects (outside the classroom) with or without a team. Feel free to add suggestions to refine my code
or ask for help.

All this is to improve and evolve as a computer scientist to ultimately be prepared for the years ahead!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Using pygame to create a simple chess program
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Python, discrete maths, cryptography and computer architecture
- ðŸ“– I'm currently reading: Discrete maths and it's applications, Mathematical methods of physics and engineering and cracking the coding interview
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: My chess game which will initially be a PVP game
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Using machine learning to improve the AI in the chess game/any notes or flashcards on discrete maths so I can prepare for Y1 of University
